The Amazon CloudFormation template of this solution will automatically deploy a serverless architecture, including services such as Amazon EventBridge , Amazon Simple Notification Service , Amazon Lambda , and Amazon Secrets Manager to store credentials required by third-party platforms. You only need to obtain credential information from a third-party platform and store it securely in Amazon Secrets Manager, and the solution will automatically configure the alarm push function. Scenarios This solution uses a series of serverless services to help customers push alert information generated by Amazon Web Services to communication platforms such as WeChat or alarm platforms in a flexible and low-cost way. suitable for monitoring cloud resources. This scenario is suitable for monitoring cloud resources. For example: Alerts when healthy events happens, like API unavailable. Alerts when the status of an Amazon EC2 instance changes (new instances are launched, instances are stopped) Alert when a file is deleted in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Alarms when the JVM memory or capacity of the Amazon Elasticsearch service reaches 80% Alerts when any user, or specific user, logs in to the Amazon Web Services Console Alerts when Amazon Security Hub discovers security risks and compliance issues Alerts when an alert message is generated by SaaS partners supported by Amazon EventBridge, such as Auth0, MongoDB, etc. Customer-defined business metrics to alert in specific situations Architecture The solution deploys 2 Amazon EventBridge rules, 1 Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic and 1 Lambda function, and also used customer pre-configured Amazon Secrets Manager secrets to send alert to apps or alert platforms. The EventBridge rules are triggered when there are EC2 State Change or Health State Change, then push a message to the SNS topic, which triggers a Lambda function to send message body to alert platforms like WeChat, using credentials in Secrets Manager. Customers can also created new EventBridge rules to monitor other state change of resources.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#solution-description","text":"Serverless Alert Notifier is an one-click serverless solution that help customers send alert notification to common Chinese communication platforms or alert platforms.
